      <h1>High Weekly Income</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>

	    <br>
	    <p>Through the observation of the 2016 data set showing the weekly income of males between the ages of 25 and 35 in Sydney, 
	    Mesh blocks are colored accordingly to show income levels. The lighter blue areas have lower weekly income and the 
		darker purple areas are the highest income areas.
	    Areas in the Eastern Suburbs as well as in the City have higher weekly income rates, as well as in industrial areas 
	    due to a higher population of men and higher paying jobs. Expensive areas in the North Shore and around beaches
	    are mostly light purple or blue not because of a lower income but because they are largely populated by families and
		    retireees. </p>
		    <p>The Latte line runs down through the middle of Northern Sydney and through to the 
	    Eastern suburbs which doesn't follow a specific pattern but does enclose the wealthier areas of Sydney and 
	    the main universities and industrial workplaces which makes sense as they would be heavily populated with young men.</p>
	    	    <p>Through the observation and comparison of data sets, it is evident that the welathiest, most educated 
		    single men are situated in the Eastern suburbs (Bondi Area), Northern beaches and inner city. With this information,
	    you are now able to find the most eligible bachelor. </p>

      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p> The issue that arises from this data is that the most eligible bachelors are localised within their respective areas, making it
	      a challenge to potentially meet one as they aren't in one central location. Due to their wealth, this also means they live
	      in extremely expensive areas which are simply unattainable for regular girls like myself. 
	    <br> I have attached a link listing some real estate prices in Bondi Beach

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-device-desktop icon"></span>What Needs to be Addressed?</h3>
        <p>The main problems that must be identified include the location of the men: the wealthiest areas are too spread out to 
	      be able to pinpoint where you could find your bachelor, and the fact that they may not go for the regular girl:
	      most girls can't afford to live in those areas so how will they get noticed by the wealthy men?</p>

      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <div class="block"></div>
      <p>Taking all of the previous imformation into account, there are a number of possible solutions; However, the final solution 
	      is big, exciting and addresses all of the issues listed above. 
	    <br>The Pier</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-device-desktop icon"></span>What is The Pier?</h3>
        <p>The Pier is a new and exciting estate-like establishment that spans the harbour, linking Point Piper in the city to Ashfield
	      Park in the North Shore. It acts as accomodation and a safe haven for young women and boasts beautiful views of the 
	      harbour, a native park and the City of Sydney. Whilst it accomodates young women, it's facilities are open to the 
	      public - with cafes and state of the art public meeting places. It hosts beach parties and celebratory events
	      aimed at both men and women in their 20's.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h3><span class="typcn typcn-pen icon"></span>How Does it Address These Issues?</h3>
        <p>The Pier links two of the wealthiest areas together - The City and The North Shore, making it easily accessible and a 
	      hot spot for wealthy men living in the area. The parties and events as well as the facilities in the area are
	      an excellent way to attract young people and encourage them to meet and get to know one-another. It also allows
	      young women to live in an exciting new area without the excessive price tag as it is exclusively for women only. This
	      also adds an extra element of safety to the solution. Whilst the plan is intended in a light-hearted and fun way to 
	      get to know new people, there are always elements of risk - this is intended to minimise all risk factors.</p>

	    <p>This is an interactive draft design of the Pier and all of the buildings it is made up of. It spans across

	    maintaining individuality, representing the unique nature of human kind whilst giving off a fun and playful atmosphere.</p>
